You can run tests across all supported versions using tox_. Make sure you have a checked-out version of the project from:

https://bitbucket.org/schinckel/django-boardinghouse/

If you have `tox`_ installed, then you'll be able to run it from the checked out directory.

Bugs and feature requests can be reported on BitBucket, and Pull Requests may be accepted.
